# swift-custom-menu

This is a sample project whose only purpose is to act as an example of how to add a custom menu to a Swift Cocoa project for Mac OSX. The functions in the main ViewContainer in this example respond to both First Responder and Custom NSMenu actions. For those of you trying to figure out how to connect your menu items and custom menu items to your ViewController you have come to the right place. For those of you who have figured out you can easily connect your menus to your AppDlegate but are now trying to figure out how to get a reference to your main ViewControler from your AppDelegate; likely you are going down the wrong path and you should check this example code out.
